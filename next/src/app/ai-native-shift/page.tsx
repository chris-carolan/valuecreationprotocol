        <h2>Protocol and implementation are different layers</h2>
        <p>
          The Value Creation Protocol describes how value flows in an AI-native business — the
          vocabulary, the operating model, the architectural commitments. It is platform-agnostic,
          declarable, and open. Anyone can read it, cite it, and operate on it without engaging the
          originating firm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The AI-Native Shift is one delivery vehicle for VCP. It is the way Value-First Team brings
          VCP to business leaders: a daily show that works through the operating model in public, and
          a structured program that brings the protocol into the inside of an organization. Both the
          show and the program live at ainativeshift.com. Other implementations of VCP are welcome.
          The protocol does not require this one.
        </p>

        <h2>If you are reading to implement</h2>
        <p>
          If you are a leadership team looking to operationalize VCP in your own organization — not
          just study the protocol — the AI-Native Shift is where the implementation work happens. The
          standalone home for the show, the program, and the framework reference (including the
          reciprocal page at <code>ainativeshift.com/vcp</code>) is ainativeshift.com.

          The protocol is open. Practitioners and firms outside Value-First Team are free to
          implement VCP on their own terms — adapt it, cite it, operate by it. If you are building
          such an implementation, the encoding stack (<a href="/encoding-stack">Lexicon</a>,{' '}
          <a href="/vcp-lang">VCP-Lang</a>, <a href="/value-graph">Value Graph</a>) is where the
